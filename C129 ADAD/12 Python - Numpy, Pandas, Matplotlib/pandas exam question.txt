1.Load the dataset and display the first 5 rows
2.Check for missing values in the dataset
3.Drop the Outlet_Establishment_Year column from the dataset.
4.Create a new column Price_per_Weight by dividing Item_MRP by Item_Weight. Then, find the maximum and minimum values in this new column.
5.Filter the dataset to include only rows where Item_Type contains the word "Snack."
6.Group the dataset by Outlet_Type and calculate the average Sales for each group.
7.Filter the dataset to display only Low Fat items with Sales greater than 1000.
8.Calculate the cumulative sum of Sales for each Outlet_Type and plot it.
9.Filter the dataset to include only rows where Item_Visibility is above the median and Item_Fat_Content is 'Low Fat'.
10.Create a pivot table that shows both the average and total Sales for each Outlet_Type and Item_Type.
11.Aggregate the dataset to show the average Sales for each combination of Item_Fat_Content and Outlet_Location_Type.
12.Assume the data has a Date column. Plot the Sales over time to identify trends.
